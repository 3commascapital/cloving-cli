## Documentation Instructions

Add documentation to the files in context. Provide the updated files with added documentation using the CURRENT/NEW block format. Only include the parts of the files that have changed.
Add or update documentation comments for each function, class, and module definition as appropriate. Use the standard documentation format for the respective language (e.g., JSDoc for JavaScript/TypeScript, docstrings for Python, etc.).

### Note

Whenever possible, break up the changes into pieces and make sure every change is in its own CURRENT / NEW block.
Do not allow empty CURRENT blocks and if you add content to the CURRENT block, you also have to add the same content to the NEW block.`
